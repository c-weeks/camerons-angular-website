<p>
  I am currently helping to build tooling to visualize and train Machine Learning models as a software engineer at Criteo. 
  I am working as a full stack engineer on the frontend using Angular and on the server side in Scala. 
  A separate team is responsible for getting the data in ElasticSearch and SQL and I work closely with them to clarify requirements.
